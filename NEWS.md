# JMbayes2 0.1.7

## Major
* Added the function `tvBrier()` for calculating time-varying Brier score for fitted joint models. Currently, only right-censored data are supported.

* Added the functions `calibration_plot()` and `calibration_metrics()` for calculating time-varying calibration plot and calibration metrics for fitted joint models. Currently, only right-censored data are supported.

* Added new section in the vignette for Dynamic Prediction (available on the [website of the package](https://drizopoulos.github.io/JMbayes2/)) to showcase the use of the functions mentioned above. 

## Minor
* Improved the plot method for dynamic predictions.

* Several bug corrections.

# JMbayes2 0.1.6

## Major
* Added a `predict()` method for `jm` objects and a corresponding `plot()` for objects of class `predict_jm` for calculating and displaying predictions from joint models. Currently, only standard survival models are covered. Future versions will include predictions from competing risks and multi-state models.

* Added the functions `tvROC()` and `tvAUC()` for calculating time-varying Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and the areas under the ROC curves for fitted joint models. Currently, only right-censored data are supported.

* Added a vignette (available on the [website of the package](https://drizopoulos.github.io/JMbayes2/)) to explain how (dynamic) predictions are calculated in the package. 


# JMbayes2 0.1.5

## Major
* Added two vignettes (available on the [website of the package](https://drizopoulos.github.io/JMbayes2/)) to showcase joint models with competing risks and joint models with non-Gaussian longitudinal outcomes.

* Simplified syntax and additional options for specifying [transformation functions of functional forms](https://drizopoulos.github.io/JMbayes2/articles/Transformation_Functions.html).

* The `slope()` function has gained two new arguments, `eps` and `direction`. This allows calculating the difference of the longitudinal profile over a user-specified interval.


# JMbayes2 0.1.3

## Minor
* Used `parallel::clusterSetRNGStream()` in `jm_fit()` for distributing the seed in the workers.
* Changed the default position of the knots for the B-spline approximation of the log baseline hazard.


# JMbayes2 0.1.2

## Minor
* Changed calls to `floor()` in the C++ code.


# JMbayes2 0.1.0

## General
* First version of the package.
